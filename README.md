## Features
* Support for Nintendo Switch and Nintendo 3DS Friend Codes

* Dice
  * Use `r!dice` or `r!die` to roll a die. A great alternative to settling it in Smash!

* 8 Ball
  * Use `r!8ball [Yes or No Question]` to seek answers from the cosmos.

  * Customize whether your friends can request your individual friend codes.
    * (The alternative is you sending your code to chat yourself.)
